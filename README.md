# GoAnimate-Wrapper
This Node.JS project is designed to be an API wrapper for GoAnimate's (now Vyond's) Legacy Video Maker.  It had been retired on 19th December 2019, 03:10 UTC.  At the moment, I have yet to implement data persistence.
## How to Use
To access this service, I have provided two options:
1. Navigate to [this site on EvenNode](http://goanimate-wrapper.eu-4.evennode.com/) to view a pre-configured server.
2. If it doesn't work, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download this project.  Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd {PATH}
npm install
npm start
```
