# Wrapper
Wrapper is a rewrite of the GoAnimate/Vyond API in JavaScript. 

# Prerequisites
- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)
- `npm`
  - `npm is included with node.js`

# Asset server
By default, the asset server is hosted on [127.0.0.1:3000](https://127.0.0.1:3000/).
If you would like to host the asset server yourself, then click [here](https://github.com/2Epik4u/Wrapper-Online-Assets), follow `README.md` and change `config.json` to reflect the change.
